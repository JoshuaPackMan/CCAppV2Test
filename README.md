# CreditCardRewardsApp
This app lets users compare the different rewards that they can get at businesses with various credit cards. The app queries a MySQL DB 
with PHP to display all the businesses and credit cards in the database, and then shows the rewards for the
businesses and cards that the user selects. The app stores the user's last selected credit card types in a text file on their 
device so that the user does not have to reselect their credit card types every time they open the app. See a demo video of the app here:
